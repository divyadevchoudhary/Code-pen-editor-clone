Hello,
I am Divya Dev Choudhary,
This is my First Major Project in Frontend.
I made a codepen(https://codepen.io/) clone which is website in which you can directly code in HTML, CSS & JS
in realtime.
In otherwords your code will run whenever u type any code.
It has 4 separate coloumns for each HTML, CSS,JS & one for the output.
If you refresh the page your data will not be affected as it runs on a HTTP server and uses local storage.

You can Start the program by running :
npm start or yarn start command in your terminal.
